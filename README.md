Introduction to Dapper 🎯
🔹 What is Dapper? 🤔
It's a simple object mapping framework or Micro-ORM that efficiently maps SQL query results to .NET classes. 🗺️ It extends IDbConnection, simplifies setup, execution, and provides useful extension methods to query your database.

By using Dapper, you can write SQL statements as if you were doing it in SQL Server. 😎 Plus, Dapper's incredible performance comes from not translating queries written in .NET to SQL.

💼 It supports multiple database providers too!

Dapper vs. Entity Framework Core 🏎️
🔹 EF Core is feature-rich, while Dapper is a lean Micro ORM. 🤝 Though they're different, let's compare!

Dapper is lightning-fast ⚡, but it doesn't mean EF Core is slow. With each EF Core update, performance keeps getting better. Dapper excels for query enthusiasts who love working directly with queries, not LINQ.

🤝 Embrace the best of both worlds! Use Dapper for complex queries and EF Core for class generation, object tracking, mapping nested classes, and more.

Let's dive into the code 👇
🔗 Find how Dapper integrates smoothly with Entity Framework Core in this article's source code. We'll explore using both frameworks together in a Web API, repositories, and usage examples. 💻 We'll even combine them in a transaction!

💡 Necessary facilities to use "Dapper":
💡 Installations required to use "Entity Framework Core" in your project:

⚙️ We'll use SQL Server Express LocalDB database. Execute the provided command to create the database and add test data when running the API project.

Entity Framework Core Configuration 🏭
💼 Data access involves entity classes and a context object representing a session with the database. This context allows querying and saving data with DbContext:

💼 IReadRepositoryBase interface for read-only repository in EF Core:

💼 IRepositoryBase interface for read and write repository in EF Core:

Dapper Configuration 🚀
📑 To work with Dapper, you'll need a "DbConnection", SQL text, and optional parameters like "DbTransaction", command timeout, query parameters, etc.

🔍 Read class: No binding to any DbContext (Entity Framework Core) object here. For reading data, we directly use IDbConnection like SqlConnection with a known connection string. See the implementation below:

🔍 Read-write class: Sharing the connection comes into play when there's data writing involved. We reuse the context object to execute queries and commands with Dapper's help. Check out how we implement it:

Explore a repository with Dapper and EF Core 📚
💼 In this repository, you can make use of both Dapper and EF Core according to your needs. 🔄 Examples include queries with one-to-one, one-to-many relationships, and implementing transactions with Dapper and EF Core. 🔄 If something fails, all changes are reverted, both those made with Dapper and EF Core.

👉 That's all for now! Stay tuned as I keep updating and adding more content to this post. I hope this article gives you a clear idea of how to easily integrate Dapper with Entity Framework Core, optimizing critical paths and working around limitations. 🎉
